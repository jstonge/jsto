@book{boyd-graber_applications_2017,

	isbn = {978-1-68083-308-9},
	abstract = {How can a single person understand what's going on in a collection of millions of documents? This is an increasingly widespread problem: sifting through an organization's e-mails, understanding a decade worth of newspapers, or characterizing a scientific field's research. This monograph explores the ways that humans and computers make sense of document collections through tools called topic models. Topic models are a statistical framework that help users understand large document collections; not just to find individual documents but to understand the general themes present in the collection. Applications of Topic Models describes the recent academic and industrial applications of topic models. In addition to topic models' effective application to traditional problems like information retrieval, visualization, statistical inference, multilingual modeling, and linguistic understanding, Applications of Topic Models also reviews topic models' ability to unlock large text collections for qualitative analysis. It reviews their successful use by researchers to help understand fiction, non-fiction, scientific publications, and political texts. Applications of Topic Models is aimed at the reader with some knowledge of document processing, basic understanding of some probability, and interested in many application domains. It discusses the information needs of each application area, and how those specific needs affect models, curation procedures, and interpretations. By the end of the monograph, it is hoped that readers will be excited enough to attempt to embark on building their own topic models. It should also be of interest to topic model experts as the coverage of diverse applications may expose models and approaches they had not seen before.},

	abstract = {Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems – such as communities – through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with – what we believe to be – their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.},

Constructing this list is timeconsuming and often subject to user judgments about what kinds of words are important to the model and the application. Although stopword removal clearly affects which word types appear as most probable terms in topics, we argue that this improvement is superﬁcial, and that topic inference beneﬁts little from the practice of removing stopwords beyond very frequent terms. Removing corpus-speciﬁc stopwords after model inference is more transparent and produces similar results to removing those words prior to inference.},

Despite their frequent use in topic modeling, we ﬁnd that stemmers produce no meaningful improvement in likelihood and coherence and in fact can degrade topic stability.},

Methods to remove duplicate texts are typically heuristic or very expensive, so it is vital to know when and why they are needed. We measure the sensitivity of two latent semantic methods to the presence of different levels of document repetition. By artiﬁcially creating different forms of duplicate text we conﬁrm several hypotheses about how repeated text impacts models. While a small amount of duplication is tolerable, substantial over-representation of subsets of the text may overwhelm meaningful topical patterns.},
